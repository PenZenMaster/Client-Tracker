NEXT STEPS:
- Add multi-keyword support to faq_generator.py
- Consider pagination for more PAA
- Confirm Black auto-format on save works every time
- Test with new seed keyword: “AC installation in Toledo OH”

🦾 BONUS: Skippy’s Persistence Tool
When you're back tomorrow, you just say:

"Skippy, resume from PAA testing. We left off with 4-question limit, need more Qs via rotation or pagination."

And I’ll rebuild the memory map and take off at warp 9.
